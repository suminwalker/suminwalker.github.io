  biography: `Sumin Walker is a seasoned app developer specializing in mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop applications, with a proven track record of bringing MVPs to life. Her expertise spans the full product development lifecycle—from concept validation to scalable, production-ready solutions.

Currently, Sumin is developing an innovative video editing and generation platform powered by AI. The app helps creators brainstorm content that resonates with audiences, generate new videos, and streamline the editing process. It features deep social media channel integration and geofencing capabilities for location-aware content strategies.

She's also working on a stealth-mode project that leverages AI and geolocation technology to provide real-time policy notifications. The app alerts users to regulatory changes as they cross state borders or approach restricted areas—solving a critical compliance challenge for mobile professionals.`,
  approach: `My development philosophy centers on three pillars: user-first design, intelligent automation, and seamless integration.

I believe the best apps anticipate user needs before they arise. By combining AI capabilities with location-aware features like geofencing, I create experiences that feel intuitive and contextually relevant. Every MVP I build is architected for growth—starting lean but ready to scale.

Whether it's integrating social media APIs, implementing real-time notifications, or building AI-powered content tools, I focus on shipping products that solve real problems and delight users.`,

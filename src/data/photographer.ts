  biography: `Sumin Walker is a product designer and app developer specializing in AI-driven mobile and desktop applications. With expertise in computer vision, generative AI, and multimodal design systems, she transforms complex technologies into intuitive, human-centered experiences that feel effortless and intelligent. Her work spans the full product lifecycle—from research and interaction design to developing scalable, production-ready MVPs using AI-powered pipelines.

Currently, she's building a video intelligence platform that helps creators brainstorm, edit, and generate content using computer vision and deep learning, complete with geofencing, real-time analytics, and social automation. In parallel, she's completing the development of a stealth AI + geolocation mobile and desktop app that uses Edge AI and real-time policy detection to alert professionals to regulatory risks as they move—merging AI ethics, compliance innovation, and mobile UX design into one seamless experience.`,
  approach: `My philosophy centers on three pillars: human-centered design, intelligent automation, and seamless integration.

Great products start with deep user empathy. I begin every project with research and discovery, mapping user journeys and pain points before touching a single pixel. From wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, I craft interfaces that feel intuitive from the first interaction.

By combining thoughtful UI/UX design with AI capabilities and location-aware features, I create experiences that anticipate user needs. Every MVP I build balances beautiful design with solid architecture—starting lean but ready to scale.`,

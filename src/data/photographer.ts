  biography: `Sumin Walker is a product designer and app developer specializing in mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop applications, with a proven track record of bringing MVPs to life. Her expertise spans the full product development lifecycle—from user research and UI/UX design to scalable, production-ready solutions.

With a deep foundation in product design, Sumin crafts intuitive interfaces and seamless user experiences that put people first. She bridges the gap between design and development, ensuring every pixel serves a purpose and every interaction feels natural.

Currently, Sumin is developing an innovative video editing and generation platform powered by AI. The app helps creators brainstorm content that resonates with audiences, generate new videos, and streamline the editing process. It features deep social media channel integration and geofencing capabilities for location-aware content strategies.

She's also working on a stealth-mode project that leverages AI and geolocation technology to provide real-time policy notifications. The app alerts users to regulatory changes as they cross state borders or approach restricted areas—solving a critical compliance challenge for mobile professionals.`,
  approach: `My philosophy centers on three pillars: human-centered design, intelligent automation, and seamless integration.

Great products start with deep user empathy. I begin every project with research and discovery, mapping user journeys and pain points before touching a single pixel. From wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, I craft interfaces that feel intuitive from the first interaction.

By combining thoughtful UI/UX design with AI capabilities and location-aware features, I create experiences that anticipate user needs. Every MVP I build balances beautiful design with solid architecture—starting lean but ready to scale.`,

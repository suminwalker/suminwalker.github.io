  biography: `Sumin Walker is a product designer and app developer specializing in AI-driven mobile and desktop applications. With hands-on experience in computer vision, generative AI, and multimodal design systems, she transforms complex technologies into intuitive user experiences.

Her expertise spans the full product lifecycle—from user research and interaction design to building scalable, production-ready MVPs using AI-powered pipelines. Sumin bridges design and development through a human-centered, data-informed approach that makes every interface both intelligent and effortless.

Currently, she's developing a video intelligence platform that helps creators brainstorm, edit, and generate content through computer vision and deep learning. The platform integrates geofencing, real-time analytics, and social media automation to help users craft content that resonates globally.

She's also building a stealth AI + geolocation project for a client that leverages Edge AI and real-time policy detection to alert professionals about regulatory risks as they move—merging AI ethics, compliance innovation, and mobile UX design into one seamless experience.`,
  approach: `My philosophy centers on three pillars: human-centered design, intelligent automation, and seamless integration.

Great products start with deep user empathy. I begin every project with research and discovery, mapping user journeys and pain points before touching a single pixel. From wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, I craft interfaces that feel intuitive from the first interaction.

By combining thoughtful UI/UX design with AI capabilities and location-aware features, I create experiences that anticipate user needs. Every MVP I build balances beautiful design with solid architecture—starting lean but ready to scale.`,
